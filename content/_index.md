This is my personal website. It will eventually link to my various self-hosted
services along with blog posts on how I set them up, among other topics. These
posts are mostly for my own reference, so they might not always be fully
up-to-date, but if you notice any issues you can
[create an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ldmitch/ldmitch.dev/issues/new).
Alternatively, my main forms of contact are <cite>listed below[^1]</cite>:
