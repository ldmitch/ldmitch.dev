This is my personal website. I've linked to my various self-hosted
services below in [projects](#projects), along with [blog posts](https://ldmitch.dev/posts) on how I set them up, among other topics. These
posts are mostly for my own reference, so they might not always be fully
up-to-date, but if you notice any issues you can
[create an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ldmitch/ldmitch.dev/issues/new).

### Projects

#### Cloud RSS
A very early, bug-prone version of a self-hostable browser-based RSS and ATOM reader. Articles from the past 48 hours are available, with content refreshing in the background every 30 minutes. Compared to a traditional RSS reader app, Cloud RSS allows you to read specific articles without connecting to the original website, reducing bandwidth consumption and lowering the risk of tracking.

[Check out Cloud RSS](https://news.ldmitch.dev/)

#### Search Select
An Apple Shortcut that provides quick access to multiple search engines and
LLMs, allowing you to easily choose between different providers and submit
queries directly from your dock or iPhone action button.
